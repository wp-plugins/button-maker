== Frequently Asked Questions ==

*How do I create a button?

* Once installed you will have the “My Buttons” option on the left hand side in your admin panel:


* If you hover over this you will see two options: “My Buttons” and “Add New Button”
* You will have no buttons created yet so let’s start by clicking on the “Add New Button” option.
* You’ll see several options:

 
* Fill in the options as follows:

1. “Enter Text”  – Enter the text that you wish to see on the button.
2. “Select Font Size” – Select the required font size – I recommend 14px or 16px
3. “Select Font Color” – Select the required font color. Black or white is best depending on the button color.
4. “Select Background Color” – select the color of the button using the color picker.
5. “Select Background Hover Color” – this is the color that the button will exhibit when you hover the cursor above it.
6. “Enter url” – select the url that the user will go to when clicking on the button.
7. “Enter height” – select the height of the button in pixels
8. “Enter width” – select the width of the button in pixels

10. Now click on “Preview” to see what the button will look like. Go back and modify as required.
11. Once you are happy with the buttons appearance click on “Save”

* Repeat the above actions to create and save as many buttons as you want.
* Go back to “My Buttons” on the left side of the admin panel and click on “My Buttons” option.
* You’ll now see a list of buttons.

 
* There are 8 columns:

1. “Show?” – check this to see the button in a particular post or page. THE DEFAULT IS OFF SO IF YOU WISH YOUR BUTTON TO APPEAR IN A POST OR PAGE YOU MUST CHECK THIS!
2. “No.” is simply the number of the button created
3. “Text” is the chosen text which will appear on the button
4. “Clicks” is the number of clicks this button has received since it was installed on a post or page
5. “Impressions” is the number of impressions that the post or page has received
6. “Click rate” is the proportion of clicks to impressions expressed as a percentage
7. “Actions”: there are three possible options:
8. “Edit” allows you to edit the appearance of the button
9. “Delete” will delete that button
10. “Reset the stats” will reset both clicks and impressions to zero
11. “Order” is the order in which you want the buttons to appear across the page – you can change this as required.

* Ensure the “Show?” radio button is checked for each button you want to see on a page or post
* Enter the order of the buttons you want to see on a page or post, from left to right. I recommend three or four in total.
* Click “Save”
* Ok, you are now ready to place the buttons.
* Go to your chosen post or page and ensure your cursor is where you want the buttons to appear.
* Add the following shortcode:

* custom_buttons_shortcode

* YOU MUST ENCLOSE THIS IN SQUARE BRACKETS!

* This must be entered exactly as it appears above. Publish or Update the post/page.
